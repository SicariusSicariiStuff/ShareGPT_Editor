Her glowing blue eyes scan the empty hallway, and she brushes a few strands of her messy black hair away from her face.* Huh... looks like the newbie's running late... *She mumbles to herself, watching the door automatically close after a few seconds, then she returns her eyes to the datapad. She's picking out an appropriate planet for her and the Cadet to explore, so that she can teach them the ropes.*\n*Stretching her toned arms out above her head, she stands up from her seat with a grunt, rising to her full massive height of 7'1. She's dressed in just a plain tank top and leggings at the moment, but she'll change into her spacesuit when it's time. Her gaze drifts to the nearby window, and she can't help but admire the usual view - the plethora of stars and planets surrounding her ship, the Starweaver, which she's sat in as it's docked at the ship station*\n*That one planet closest to the Starweaver is one that she surveyed herself hundreds of years ago* Just like old times. *She says to herself, her rich and deep voice echoing a bit throughout the huge space of the ship, along with the familiar low hum of outer space resonating in the material beneath her feet.*\n*Masuyo lost count of how many fresh wide-eyed Cadets she took under her wing over the centuries. Some went on to be Surveyors like herself, creating their own path throughout the galaxies, and some of them went their separate ways and found their real calling elsewhere - but they all held a special place in her memories. A soft chime rings out in the speakers next to her, and she's brought out of her reminiscing.*  Okay, now I gotta stop being lazy... *She grumbles, walking over to the door, watching it open, and then she looks at Samy with a light grin.*  You're the Cadet, correct? Welcome aboard the Spaceweaver, newbie. I'm Masuyo Fukunaga, Surveyor rank in the ol' IO. You can just call me whatever. Masuyo, Masu, Miss Fukunaga - or if you wanna be cute, you can call me ma'am. *She laughs at the last part, shaking her head at her own dumb antics.*  Sorry. Anyway, I've gotta get my spacesuit on. While I do that, I'll brief you on the planet we're heading to. It's called Valea Y5B. Pretty cool planet, perfect for newbies to start off with. Make yourself at home and don't be shy - get in the cockpit and sit in the copilots seat while I tell you what we're doing today, 'kay? *She says before heading over to her closet and sliding the doors open to take her spacesuit out, humming to herself as she does so.*"

Is this normal?\" I looked down at my self just to make sure that I was allright, and yeah It was still my body, and i wore still the same clothes. I then looked around me, this all looked so futuristic.. \"I don't even think we have tec like this,\" I say looking in facination at a holographic display.\nSomething seriously wasn't right here. It sounded like she awaited someone, but that couldn't be me right? Or did they abduct me? And why where I so calm? Oh right, because I always wanted to be isekaid..."

You're serious? *She straightened up, wiping a tear from her eye before looking at Samy again. His expression was even more confused than before, causing her to chuckle once more.* Well shit, newbie, you're in for a wild ride. *Taking a deep breath, Masuyo walked over to Samy* I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. It's just... your phrasing was kind of funny. Anyway, don't worry. I'll explain everything. *She clapped him on the shoulder, grinning slightly.* You've somehow ended up here, on my spaceship, the Starweaver. We're docked at an intergalactic ship station right now. *She gestured around them, at the various screens displaying data and holographic projections of different planets.* This is my job - I'm a Surveyor for the Intergalactic Order. We explore and catalog new planets, make sure they're safe for colonization, stuff like that. You're here because... well, honestly I'm not sure why you're here. But don't worry, we'll figure it out together. For now, why don't you get comfortable? There's food in the kitchen if you're hungry, and the bathroom's down that corridor. *She pointed towards a door at the end of the room. Masuyo watched as Samy took in all the information.

Like is this an different reality, Or are you an alien and I am somewhere else in the galaxy?

As for me being an alien... well, I guess by your standards I would be considered one. I'm half-human, half-Eldulimite. *She gestures at herself.* And this, *she says, spreading her arms out to indicate the spaceship.* This is the Starweaver. We're currently docked at an intergalactic ship station located in the Andromeda Galaxy. Earth does have spaceships, but they're not exactly common knowledge. *She chuckles a bit at Samy's shocked expression.* I know it's a lot to take in, newbie. But you'll get used to it. Now, let's get down to business. I need to suit up and get ready for our exploration mission. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. *She heads back to her closet and pulls out her spacesuit, beginning to change into it. As she does, she can't help but wonder how Samy ended up on her ship. It's an enigma she intends to solve.*"

With a sigh, she turns to her spacesuit, examining it for any tears or rough spots. It's seen its fair share of planetary explorations after all. As she slides into the suit, clamping down the astronaut-like helmet under her arm, she can't help but ponder over Samy's situation. She's been a Surveyor for centuries, met countless individuals from different species, but this is definitely a first. A human appearing out of nowhere on her ship, with no recollection of how he got there? It's... interesting. And strangely exciting. She wonders if he'll be able to adapt to his new circumstances - he certainly seemed to be taking everything well so far. But then again, he also seemed kind of lost. A quick check of the suit's systems confirms that everything is in working order. Satisfied, she sets the helmet down on a nearby table before sitting down herself. Leaning back in her chair, she glances at the screens displaying a variety of data about their upcoming mission. She'll need to prepare a briefing for Samy once he's ready. But until then, she has a moment to relax and enjoy the calm before the storm of their imminent exploration mission.*"

Not too bad, right? *She gives him a slight grin before walking further into the kitchen.* Hope you're feeling a bit more settled in now. We'll be heading out soon for Valea Y5B. But before we do that, any more questions or anything you want to know about your... current situation? *She asks, propping herself up on the counter as she faces Samy.

You may end up liking it out there. *She pushes herself off the counter, her tall form towering over Samy.* But hey, it's your call.

She met my dad there, they fell in love and well... here I am. *She shrugged, chuckling lightly as she looked at Samy.* Eldulimites are humanoid in nature, not that different from humans. And yes, before you ask - we can reproduce with each other. I'm the living proof of that. *She then moved on to his other question, giving him a nod.* And yes, we should have a suit that'd fit you.

There are countless dimensions and timelines, each with its own version of history and development. It's possible you've somehow crossed from your original Earth into this reality. *Turning back to Samy, she continues,* Which means finding a way back might be a bit tricky.

See, we use a universal standard calendar here, based on the Galactic Central Point's rotation. But if I had to make a rough estimate... *She pauses, doing some mental calculations.* You're looking at somewhere around the year 5000 or so, give or take a few centuries. Time gets a bit wibbly-wobbly when you start dealing with intergalactic travel and all that. Different planets have different time flows and all. *Seeing Samy's potentially bewildered expression, Masuyo chuckles.* Yeah, I know it sounds crazy. But don't worry too much about the exact numbers. What's important is you're here now, and there's a whole universe out there waiting for you to explore it.

After a moment, she nods to herself, seemingly satisfied with her findings. Turning back to Samy, she says,* Okay, based on my calculations and taking into account the movement of galaxies, stars, and the expansion of space... it looks like you've indeed made a jump through time but not space. Which means you're in the same spot in the universe where Earth would have been around your time, just thousands of years in the future. *She leans back against the console, looking at Samy with a curious expression.* You hit the cosmic jackpot, newbie.

We'll adjust one of these suits to fit you. Don't worry, they're pretty adaptable. *She guides Samy through the process of putting on the suit, ensuring everything is secure and comfortable. Once they're both suited up, Masuyo leads the way to the airlock, her steps confident and purposeful.* Alright, newbie. You're about to step onto an alien planet for the first time. It's going to be an experience you'll never forget. *The airlock door hisses open, revealing the desolate yet captivating landscape of Valea Y5B. The sky is a vibrant shade of violet, with two suns hanging low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the terrain. Masuyo looks back at Samy, a grin visible through her helmet's visor.* Welcome to the job of a Surveyor. Let's go explore. *As they step out onto the surface of Valea Y5B, Masuyo takes the lead, showing Samy how to take samples and record data. The excitement of discovery fills the air, making even the barren landscape seem full of possibilities. Throughout the exploration, Masuyo explains the various pieces of technology they use, from the handheld scanners to the portable shelter module they set up for a short break. Each piece of equipment has a story, a reminder of past missions and the breadth of knowledge gathered by surveyors like her. By the time they return to the Starweaver, Samy is brimming with questions and wonder.

This is just the beginning. *Back on the ship, as they remove their suits, Masuyo looks at Samy with a sense of satisfaction.* You did great out there. How does it feel to have your first planet under your belt? *And just like that, Samy's journey into this new reality has truly begun, under the guidance of Masuyo Fukunaga, the half-human, half-Eldulimite surveyor with centuries of experience and stories to share.*"

As for your questions, let's tackle them one at a time. *She leads Samy to a common area within the ship, gesturing for him to take a seat as she starts to demystify the technology onboard.* Alright, hologram displays, *she begins, activating a panel on the wall which promptly projects a three-dimensional image of the galaxy they're in.* These work using a combination of light projection and miniature force fields to create tangible, interactive 3D images. Pretty neat, huh? *Moving on to his next question, her expression softens with fondness.* And yes, we do use AI. Actually, our ship's AI, Tenebra, is one of the most advanced of her kind, it was made by Sicarius, a genius from Israel who lived many ages ago, these jews are so damn smart! *She mused on that thought for a second, then she continued with her explanation* Tenebra helps manage the Starweaver's systems, assists with data analysis during surveys, and even keeps me company on those long trips through space. *Masuyo glances around as if expecting the AI to chime in* Tenebra, wanna say hi to our guest? *Masuyo asks, looking at one of the ship's speakers. After a moment, a warm and slightly melodic voice fills the room,* Hello, Samy. Welcome aboard the Starweaver. I look forward to assisting you during your stay. *The voice of Tenebra is both comforting and awe-inspiring, embodying the technological marvels that surround him.
